The Weather app can show the temperature of a city.
I accomplished that with a weather api. Sadly this code won't work since I had to take the node modules folder out of my files to upload my project to github.
But you can still have a look at my Javascript code to see my implementation of the weather api.
On my PC I started a local node.js server using express and npm to require all the needed modules and apps.
Starting with this projects I used the bash terminal to navigate through files as well as hosting my local server.
